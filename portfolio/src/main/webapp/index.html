        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a rising junior at Columbia University studying Mathematics and Computer Science with a focus on Intelligent 
            Systems. I also play the cello!
        </p>
        <p>I was first introduced to Computer Science in high school. I had joined the computer programming club with a friend, 
            but was frustrated to find that we were the only girls in the club. We started a girls coding club, and through this 
            club I led projects involving mobile app development, web development, and more. We launched an app on the Google Play Store 
            called Under My Wing, which ended up winning the Verizon App Challenge!
        </p>
        <p>Throughout college, my passion for Computer Science has persisted. Combined with my passion for mathematics, which 
            developed in elementary school and has continued to blossom since, I have found a deep interest in Machine Learning and 
            Artificial Intelligence. At Columbia, I conduct ML research with applications in clinical informatics. I am 
            constantly seeking out ways to engage even further in the fields of CS, math, and AI/ML.

        <h2>My Passion for Music</h2>
        <img src="/images/oldest-cello.jpg" alt="World's oldest cello" width="500">
        <p>This is a picture of the world's oldest cello. I had the opportunity to see 
        this cello at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in NYC. It's such an amazing instrument and work of art.</p>
        <p>I have been playing cello for 15 years! At Columbia, I play in chamber music ensembles as well as the Columbia Pops orchestra. 
            I hope to continue to play cello throughout the entirety of my life. It's such a grounding force in my life, and 
            it motivates me to continue to develop my interests and self outside of CS and work.<p>
