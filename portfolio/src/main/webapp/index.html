        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img src="images/headshot.jpeg"  alt="Headshot of Cassandra Marcussen" width="300">
        <p>I am a rising junior at Columbia University studying Mathematics and Computer Science with a focus on Intelligent 
            Systems. I also play the cello!
        </p>
        <p>I was first introduced to Computer Science in high school. I had joined the computer programming club with a friend, 
            but was frustrated to find that we were the only girls in the club. We started a girls coding club, and through this 
            club I led projects involving mobile app development, web development, and more. We launched an app on the Google Play Store 
            called Under My Wing, which ended up winning the Verizon App Challenge!
        </p>
        <p>Throughout college, my passion for Computer Science has persisted. Combined with my passion for mathematics, which 
            developed in elementary school and has continued to blossom since, I have found a deep interest in Machine Learning and 
            Artificial Intelligence. At Columbia, I conduct ML research with applications in clinical informatics. I am 
            constantly seeking out ways to engage even further in the fields of CS, math, and AI/ML.
