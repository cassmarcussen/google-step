        <h2>About my hobbies</h2>
        <p>
            Growing up, I developed a deep interest in mathematics and music. I love looking back at some of my past school projects from third grade or so, 
            since they remind me that - with all the changes that have taken place in my life - there has been something in constant bloom and growth about my passions 
            and interests.
        </p>
        <p>
            Later on, in high school, I developed a passion for Computer Science as well. However, this came at little surprise to me when I looked back at my 
            childhood days of solving logic puzzles and math games. Computer Science, to me, is one giant logic puzzle with problems that I have yet to solve. That's 
            one of the reasons I love it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of math and CS, I have continued my musical studies, and I try to have fun while doing so! I play music with friends and I don't limit myself 
            to any particular genre. I love playing classical music on the cello, but I also like playing pop music, rock music, and everything else! Music included, 
            I aim to continue to develop myself and my interests outside of work, and find new ways to do so all of the time. Spending time on music, outdoors, and with family 
            and friends (even if it's virtually) makes me a happier, more well-rounded person.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of my long-held hobbies is playing board games. From Risk, to Settlers of Catan, to Monopoly and Mastermind, board games teach me strategy and how to plan 
            ahead, alongside the fun and collaborative spirit of board games. I tend to enjoy strategy games more than games of chance, but I'm really open to trying out any 
            new board games.

        <h2>My Passion for Music</h2>
        <img src="/images/oldest-cello.jpg" alt="World's oldest cello" width="500">
        <p>This is a picture of the world's oldest cello. I had the opportunity to see 
        this cello at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in NYC. It's such an amazing instrument and work of art.</p>
        <p>I have been playing cello for 15 years! At Columbia, I play in chamber music ensembles as well as the Columbia Pops orchestra. 
            I hope to continue to play cello throughout the entirety of my life. It's such a grounding force in my life, and 
            it motivates me to continue to develop my interests and self outside of CS and work.

        <h2>Some Cello Videos</h2>
        <p>Here are some vidoes from my Senior Cello Recital in 2018. While these videos are 2 years old, they are still some of my favorite videos of my cello playing!<p>

        <h2>Hiking, biking, and more!</h2>
        <p>
            I've always loved nature. I'm really not the most athletic of people, but I try to get outdoors sometimes to exercise or more generally to just appreciate nature.
        </p>
        <p>
            Recently, I've been going on bikes or hikes with my family and girlfriend. It's a great way to spend time outside while remaining socially distant. I live close to NY, 
            where there a lot of expansive forests that are wonderful for hiking. If I go at the right hour, sometimes I don't see a single other person. However, I do see a lot of 
            wildlife, such as clusters of deer. It's so fun!
