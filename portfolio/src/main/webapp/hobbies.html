        <h2>About my hobbies</h2>
        <p>
            Growing up, I developed a deep interest in mathematics and music. I love looking back at some of my past school projects from third grade or so, 
            since they remind me that - with all the changes that have taken place in my life - there has been something in constant bloom and growth about my passions 
            and interests.
        </p>
        <p>
            Later on, in high school, I developed a passion for Computer Science as well. However, this came at little surprise ot me when I looked back at my 
            childhood days of solving logic puzzles and math games. Computer Science, to me, is one giant logic puzzle with problems that I have yet to solve. That's 
            one of the reasons I love it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of math and CS, I have continued my musical studies, and I try to have fun while doing so! I play music with friends and I don't limit myself 
            to any particular genre.

        <h2>Some Cello Videos</h2>
        <p>Here are some vidoes from my Senior Cello Recital in 2018. While these videos are 2 years old, they are still some of my favorite videos of my cello playing!<p>

        <h2>Hiking, biking, and more!</h2>
        <p>
            I've always loved nature. I'm really not the most athletic of people, but I try to get outdoors sometimes to exercise or more generally to just appreciate nature.
        </p>
        <p>
            Recently, I've been going on bikes or hikes with my family and girlfriend. It's a great way to spend time outside while remaining socially distant. I live close to NY, 
            where there a lot of expansive forests that are wonderful for hiking. If I go at the right hour, sometimes I don't see a single other person. However, I do see a lot of 
            wildlife, such as clusters of deer. It's so fun!
