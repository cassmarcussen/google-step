        <h2>Week 1</h2>
        <p>This week primarily consisted of watching Grow onboarding videos and meeting with my STEP Pod. It was a great introduction to Google 
            as a company, the team I will be a part of during the internship, and some important technical concepts that I still need to improve on.
        </p>
        <p>
            To me, the most insightful technical training video I watched was the "Testing Code" video. While I have tested my own code for school projects 
            and other smaller projects, I've never been taught how to extensively write unit tests. On top of that, I was never taught the intuition behind why testing 
            is so important. The "Testing Code" video taught me about test-driven development, and the important of tests to document code and to facilitate the modification 
            of existing code. The tests are essentially the first users of the code, which was interesting for me to learn about.

        <h2>Week 2</h2>
        <p>This week, I worked on the front-end development of my portfolio website. While I have been exposed to front-end in the past, for example by building 
            web apps for small businesses as well as for my internship at Amazon last summer, this week was a great way to brush up my front-end skills while making 
            a fun website. I challenged myself to add components such as a navbar which I hadn't used so much in the past. I enjoyed learning about how to use the Google Cloud Shell, as well about the style guidelines of Google.
        </p>
        <p>
            This week, I also attended the livestream events "Intro to Google Internships", "Intro to Open Source", and "STEP Intern Program Overview" (I attended these 
            this week due to registration issues last week). These livestreams gave me a better sense of Google's values, internal policies, and the awesome 
            opportunities present at Google. These livestream sessions made me even more enthusiastic about my internship and the opportunity to work at Google!

        <h2>Week 3</h2>
        <p>This week, I built an extensible Comments section for different aspects of my website. I have comments sections for each of the weekly reflections on the 
            STEP Internships page (you can find a comments section below this description!). This week, there was a lot of new learning, including how to use Java 
            servlets and how to use DataStore. I therefore spent time carefully going through the tutorials for Week 3, so that I fully and deeply understood the 
            concepts I was learning. This was very helpful as I started to implement some of the new learnings. I ended up filling up the rest of my notebook with 
            notes that I had taken during the tutorials.
        </p>
        <p>
           This week, I really wanted to challenge myself to go above and beyond the tutorial expectations. To do so, I created a comments section in multiple locations, not 
           just one (only one was required). This required that I send information about which Comments section to add to to my Java servlet. Doing so required a lot of 
           debugging, sketching design ideas in my notebook, and careful thinking. I created an enum called Location which stores the different locations. I pass in the 
           location to the JavaScript and Java servlet through a series of parameters. For example, for getComments, I'll pass in the location as getComments("Week3") to indicate 
           that the DataStore list that we want to get comments from is Week3.
        </p>
        <p>
            I thought the trickiest component of this week's project was updating the number of comments to be displayed. This was difficult when I just had one comments section, 
            but especially when I had multiple comment sections, coordinating exactly which comment section displayed which number of comments was difficult. I had to ask myself the following questions: 
            When do I want to get information from values that the user inputs in input fields in the HTML? When do I want to store information in my JavaScript code, and when do I 
            want to store information on the server side, in my Java servlet code? How do I pass values between my HTML, JavaScript, and my Java servlet? I found these questions to be 
            very insightful to think about. Because of these sorts of questions, this week challenged me to grow and improve my abilities to write code that is approaching full-stack. I really enjoyed 
            this week's assignment, and learned so much!
