        <h2>Week 1</h2>
        <p>This week primarily consisted of watching Grow onboarding videos and meeting with my STEP Pod. It was a great introduction to Google 
            as a company, the team I will be a part of during the internship, and some important technical concepts that I still need to improve on.
        </p>
        <p>
            To me, the most insightful technical training video I watched was the "Testing Code" video. While I have tested my own code for school projects 
            and other smaller projects, I've never been taught how to extensively write unit tests. On top of that, I was never taught the intuition behind why testing 
            is so important. The "Testing Code" video taught me about test-driven development, and the important of tests to document code and to facilitate the modification 
            of existing code. The tests are essentially the first users of the code, which was interesting for me to learn about.

        <h2>Week 2</h2>
        <p>This week, I worked on the front-end development of my portfolio website. While I have been exposed to front-end in the past, for example by building 
            web apps for small businesses as well as for my internship at Amazon last summer, this week was a great way to brush up my front-end skills while making 
            a fun website. I challenged myself to add components such as a navbar which I hadn't used so much in the past. I enjoyed learning about how to use the Google Cloud Shell, as well about the style guidelines of Google.
        </p>
        <p>
            This week, I also attended the livestream events "Intro to Google Internships", "Intro to Open Source", and "STEP Intern Program Overview" (I attended these 
            this week due to registration issues last week). These livestreams gave me a better sense of Google's values, internal policies, and the awesome 
            opportunities present at Google. These livestream sessions made me even more enthusiastic about my internship and the opportunity to work at Google!

        <h2>Week 3</h2>
        <p>This week, I built an extensible Comments section for different aspects of my website. I have comments sections for each of the weekly reflections on the 
            STEP Internships page (you can find a comments section below this description!). This week, there was a lot of new learning, including how to use Java 
            servlets and how to use DataStore. I therefore spent time carefully going through the tutorials for Week 3, so that I fully and deeply understood the 
            concepts I was learning. This was very helpful as I started to implement some of the new learnings. I ended up filling up the rest of my notebook with 
            notes that I had taken during the tutorials.
        </p>
        <p>
           This week, I really wanted to challenge myself to go above and beyond the tutorial expectations. To do so, I created a comments section in multiple locations, not 
           just one (only one was required). This required that I send information about which Comments section to add to to my Java servlet. Doing so required a lot of 
           debugging, sketching design ideas in my notebook, and careful thinking. I created an enum called Location which stores the different locations. I pass in the 
           location to the JavaScript and Java servlet through a series of parameters. For example, for getComments, I'll pass in the location as getComments("Week3") to indicate 
           that the DataStore list that we want to get comments from is Week3.
        </p>
        <p>
            I thought the trickiest component of this week's project was updating the number of comments to be displayed. This was difficult when I just had one comments section, 
            but especially when I had multiple comment sections, coordinating exactly which comment section displayed which number of comments was difficult. I had to ask myself the following questions: 
            When do I want to get information from values that the user inputs in input fields in the HTML? When do I want to store information in my JavaScript code, and when do I 
            want to store information on the server side, in my Java servlet code? How do I pass values between my HTML, JavaScript, and my Java servlet? I found these questions to be 
            very insightful to think about. Because of these sorts of questions, this week challenged me to grow and improve my abilities to write code that is approaching full-stack. I really enjoyed 
            this week's assignment, and learned so much!

        <h2>Week 4</h2>
        <p>This week, I learned how to use various Google APIs and libraries and integrated them into my website. I initially 
            chose to learn how to use the Google Charts and Google Maps API, and afterwards added the usage of the Blobstore API as 
            well. Even though we only had to use each API once, for two APIs, I wanted to incorporate in Blobstore as a third API because 
            I thought it could potentially be useful to know for the upcoming Capstone project. Throughout the week, I learned how 
            to represent data from data sets using Google Charts and Google Maps. I also used Charts in my Fun Facts page to add a visual 
            about my pets, and added a Locations page with an interactive map of Columbia's campus and collective photo gallery of the page 
            viewers' favorite locations around the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the challenges of this week was figuring out how to incorporate the API features into my portfolio website. When given 
            the APIs to choose from in the tutorials page, I found that the APIs I was most interested in learning had less of a direct or 
            intuitive application to my website. This is part of the reason why I have a STEP Projects page on my website, so that I can 
            expand my skill set on features which do not directly relate to the website. Part of figuring out this incorporation was adding a 
            Locations page. I think this is a fun way to learn more about me, which is one of the main objectives of the Portfolio website.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another challenge was figuring out how to integrate in data of various forms to the features. For example, for the Charts and Maps API, 
            I incorporated in data from a data set in CSV form and geoJSON form, correspondingly. For Locations, figuring out how to serve and gather 
            the images using the Blobstore proved to be a challenge. Working with this information of various forms, however, pushed me to think about 
            design and client-server interactions more deeply.
        </p>
        <p> Here is an overview of the features I added: 
            <ul style="text-align: left">
                <li>STEP Projects page - interactive column chart of the global warming sentiment of tweets. My goal was to learn about data representation using data from an environmental study. </li>
                <li>Fun Facts page - interactive pie chart of the distribution of my pets (by species/type) </li>
                <li>STEP Projects page - Google Map representation geographical information about wildlife management units in Vermont. My goal was to learn about how to represent geographical information using the Google Maps API. </li>
                <li>Locations page - Google Map of Columbia University with markers and info windows to locate and describe my favorite locations around campus.</li>
                <li>Locations page  (which includes a button that routes to a page to post an image) - Blobstore API so that page viewers can post images of their favorite locations to a collective image gallery. The goal was to extend my Locations page to make it more interactive, to learn how to use Blobstore to create a meaningful section of my website, and to learn how to create and style an image gallery using HTML and CSS.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            This week, I also worked on the Capstone project ideation. I came up with two ideas for the Capstone project, and added to the ideas 
            and notes about other proposed ideas. One of my ideas is a tool which displays the effect of the advertisement video to the advertiser, or 
            in other words if the advertisement has a negative, violent, or harmful effect. The other idea is an accessibility metric for video or 
            immersive panel ads, which may also be incorporated into the first idea.

        <h2>Week 5</h2>
        <p>This week, I worked on both my Starter Project for Week 5 and the Capstone project ideation and design steps. For the Week 5 Starter 
            Project, I implemented the calendar scheduler feature, for both mandatory and optional attendees, using test-driven development. 
            My work on this project can be found under the "walkthroughs --> week 5" folder in the GitHub repository.
        </p>
        <p>
            For this starter project, I focused on having a clean, extensible design. For example, when working on the functionality for scheduling 
            calendar events for mandatory attendees, I created functions with one purpose each and flexible parameters, so that when it was time 
            to work on the optional attendees functionality, I was able to add the new functionality with ease. This required just changing some parameters 
            and making extra function calls, but was facilitated by my extensible design set up in the initial steps of this starter project.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the starter project, I also wrote unit tests for edge cases and the optional attendees feature. This week, I also attended the PGP Livestream sessions for YouTube Ads.
        </p>
        <p>
            This week, for the Capstone project, I met with the two other inters to solidify our preferences for the Capstone project ideas. We filled 
            out the design doc ideation documents for our top two preferred Capstone project ideas. One of these ideas was the video-to-effect project idea I had proposed to the team. 
            This process was really valuable, since it showed the importance of ideation and good teamwork. I am enthusiastic that the other two interns and I work very 
            well together as a team.
        </p>
        <p>
            After meeting with members of the YouTube Ads Formats - Infeed team and as a Pod with hosts and inters, we chose to select the video-to-effect project idea 
            for the Capstone project. At the end of the week (Friday), the other two interns and I worked all day on our Design Doc for this idea. It is so exciting 
            to see the project idea I had thought of come to life. I believe that this is a tool that is useful and necessary for both advertisers and Google engineers. 
            I can't wait to get started! We also divided tasks and created visualizations of each of our three feature flows.

        <h2>Week 6</h2>
        <p>This week, I started to work on the 'keyframe image to effect' flow of the Capstone project, which we have named Video Vigilance. Essentially, one intern will work on 
            converting the video to keyframe images using shot change detection and image capturing. These keyframe images will be passed to my component of the project, which 
            stores and displays these images and extracts each image's effect using the Cloud Vision API. The third component will extract and display the effect of the audio 
            of the video advertisement. By 'effect', I am referring to the SafeSearch feature of the Vision API and Perspective API (for image and text, correspondingly), which 
            return the type of sensitive content that is flagged in the content passed to the API.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have implemented the Java servlets for Blobstore (GET/POST) to get and post keyframe images to a DataStore data set. I relied on tools I had learned 
            during the starter project tutorials. The POST request will be called by the intern working on video-to-keyframe image. I will call the GET request in order to 
            retrieve the keyframe images from the data set. Storing the images in a data set allows for reliability and extensibility in the structure of our web application. 
            The Vision API requires that the images are stored in a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) Bucket, so next week I will work on integrating GCS in with Blobstore.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also implemented the flow of the Vision API's SafeSearch functionality, which will take in a video from a GCS Bucket and extract its effect. I followed tutorials on the 
            Google Cloud Vision API page to learn how to do this. I also worked on the front-end display of the website, so that the effect of the image 
            is displayed using HTML meters and colors (indicating if the effect is good/medium/bad, with green/yellow/red), so that the user can understand the 
            results of the Vision API's Safe Search visually.
        </p>
        <p>
            I created Java servlets and a DetectSafeSearch file to handle getting the effect of the images. I also display the timestamp, start and end times 
            of the shot in the video that the key frame image is from. I sort the keyframe images by timestamp and implemented the logic to only display flagged keyframe images, 
            i.e. the keyframe images that do not pass the SafeSearch test.

        <h2>Week 7</h2>
        <p>This week, I completed the MVP for my standalone feature of Video Vigilance, the keyframe-images-to-effect feature. I worked on 
            connecting Google Cloud Storage Bucket to Blobstore. There are a few main reasons behind needing to work on this: First, the Vision API requires that the images it parses the effect from are stored in a Bucket. 
            Also, we want to connect Blobstore to Google Cloud Storage, instead of using just Google Cloud Storage, because we need to store other information about the keyframe images, primarily: their timestamp, and the start and end time of their shot in the video advertisement.
        </p>
        <p>
            This week, I also implemented the logic for displaying only keyframe images which have been flagged for sensitive/negative content. 
            Additionally, I implemented the logic for finding out the number of flagged keyframe images, and for displaying a ‘good job’ message if none of the video’s keyframe images have been flagged for sensitive content. 
            I focused on making sure that the logic is organized, not redundant, and is attached to a clear, user-friendly UI.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also worked on sorting the keyframe images by timestamp. This required finding a way to store the GCS image url in DataStore, and serving this url when it retrieved from DataStore. 
            In regards to the Java servlets for DataStore, I implemented a Delete request for the keyframe image storage. 
            This empties the content of the GCS bucket and DataStore, so that the information that is served on the page is guaranteed to be the data from the particular user’s video advertisement, not leftover data from past website uses. 
            I also updated the UI to be consistent with the index page’s UI and design.
        </p>
        <p>
            A challenge is that we still need to figure out how to connect the extraction of keyframe images from the video (another intern's feature) to the POST request to GCS and DataStore that I have created.

        <h2>Week 8</h2>
        <p>This week, one of my main areas of accomplishment was testing my Java code using jUnit, Mockito, and Spring. Specifically, I worked on testing my 
            POST and GET requests for the KeyframeImageUploadServlet. I also tested my POST request for the KeyframeImageDeleteServlet, i.e. the method that deletes all objects from Datastore and the Google Cloud Storage Bucket. 
            Additionally, I tested my API call for the Vision API's SafeSearch detection method and the handling of incorrectly formatted bucket path urls. 
            This was a challenge because testing Java code is new to me, outside of using print statements and other more basic testing methods. I spent a lot 
            of time reading through tutorials for jUnit, Mockito, and Spring, and especially found it difficult to mock out get and post methods despite 
            permission errors that come with these methods when using the Blobstore API. After a lot of hard work on this task, I am proud of my progress in this area 
            and am working towards 100% code coverage for my tests.
        </p>
        <p>I also made progress on Code Reviews this week, alongside the other two interns in my pod. With the other two interns, established a more productive schedule and system of requesting and giving feedback on our code. 
            Additionally, I learned to create Pull Requests which correspond to one feature or addition, instead of Pull Requests for improvements on multiple features. 
            I also am making progress on giving descriptive, thoughtful comments and feedback on my Pull Reviews. I am new to the process of giving feedback on code, 
            so this has been a great learning experience and opportunity for growth. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This week, I also cleaned up my code, based on PR comments and Google style guidelines. I also integrated all three features of Video Vigilance, alongside 
            the other two interns. Additionally, I pair programmed with Sharon over GVC to figure out the POST request to post the keyframe images 
            she extracts from the video to a database, which required using Ajax to fill in the jsp upload form. 
            The POST request must be done in this way due to Blobstore authentication errors, where the POST must be called from a valid blob address. I also met with the other 
            two interns to discuss the UI and how our features will be displayed together. I created a diagram using Google Drawings of a potential UI fix for the Results page. We created a merged version of the web application on a testing branch.
        </p>    
        <p>
            A challenge this week was testing APIs that have Permission Errors on the local website, such as the Vision API. Also, 
            testing the POST and GET for Blobstore is difficult because these requests must be called from a 'valid blob location' due to 
            Blobstore API specifications. An area of growth was learning how to give constructive feedback on Pull Requests.

        <h2>Week 9</h2>
        <p>Based on the feedback from other interns and hosts, this week I updated the UI of the meter to more clearly show how many values the meter can take on. 
            To do this, I split up the meter into 5 distinct sections. Also, I move the information hover buttons to each individual category of the Vision API's SafeSearch detection. 
            I also worked on edge case management. For example, I considered the edge case that there are multiple users of the website at the same time. 
            For this edge case, we need to give each user a unique DataStore list, so that if two or more users are using Video Vigilance simultaneously their information is kept in different locations and each of the users’ list of 
            keyframe images stored does not interfere with the other users’ information. 
            I implemented this feature for POST and GET, and still need to work on making this feature compatible with the Delete method.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also worked on testing more this week. I am currently working on testing out the use of DataStore in my feature. In addition, 
            I worked with the other interns on integrating our 3 features. 
            All of the 3 features are integrated and working together in the MVP. We can now demonstrate the entire user flow of uploading a video, choosing keyframe images, and displaying the visual and audio effect results.
