        <h2>Week 1</h2>
        <p>This week primarily consisted of watching Grow onboarding videos and meeting with my STEP Pod. It was a great introduction to Google 
            as a company, the team I will be a part of during the internship, and some important technical concepts that I still need to improve on.
        </p>
        <p>
            To me, the most insightful technical training video I watched was the "Testing Code" video. While I have tested my own code for school projects 
            and other smaller projects, I've never been taught how to extensively write unit tests. On top of that, I was never taught the intuition behind why testing 
            is so important. The "Testing Code" video taught me about test-driven development, and the important of tests to document code and to facilitate the modification 
            of existing code. The tests are essentially the first users of the code, which was interesting for me to learn about.

        <h2>Week 2</h2>
        <p>This week, I worked on the front-end development of my portfolio website. While I have been exposed to front-end in the past, for example by building 
            web apps for small businesses as well as for my internship at Amazon last summer, this week was a great way to brush up my front-end skills while making 
            a fun website. I challenged myself to add components such as a navbar which I hadn't used so much in the past. I enjoyed learning about how to use the Google Cloud Shell, as well about the style guidelines of Google.
        </p>
        <p>
            This week, I also attended the livestream events "Intro to Google Internships", "Intro to Open Source", and "STEP Intern Program Overview" (I attended these 
            this week due to registration issues last week). These livestreams gave me a better sense of Google's values, internal policies, and the awesome 
            opportunities present at Google. These livestream sessions made me even more enthusiastic about my internship and the opportunity to work at Google!
