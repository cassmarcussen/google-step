            <h2>Columbia University</h2>
            <p>I'm a rising junior at Columbia University. This is a very special campus to me, and 
                I can't wait to return, whenever that may be.

            <h2>What's your favorite location? </h2>
             <p>Especially during the outbreak of Coronavirus, I think we all find ourselves thinking about all of our favorite places around the world 
                 that we wish we could visit. Because of this, I wanted to create a space on my website where anyone and everyone can post a picture of 
                 their favorite locations in the world. This collective image gallery of some of the special locations around the world is a reminder of all 
                 of the normal, the extraordinary, and everything in between that is special to us. I encourage you to post a picture of your favorite location, be it 
                 near or far, and to reflect on what you value in the places that are most special to you.
